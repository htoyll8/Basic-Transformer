# Large Language Model

## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of a transformer model that leverages the attention mechanism to process sequences of data. It's particularly designed to work with text data and can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Architecture

The transformer model consists of multiple layers of self-attention blocks, allowing the model to pay different levels of attention to different parts of the input sequence. This attention mechanism enables the model to capture complex dependencies within the sequence, making it suitable for tasks like text generation, translation, and more.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `project_root/`
    - `config.py`: Configuration file for hyperparameters
    - `data/`
        - `input.txt`: Input data file
    - `models/`
        - `model.py`: Model definition file
    - `src/`
        - `main.py`: Main entry point
        - `train_utils.py`: Training utilities
        - `data_preparation.py`: Data preparation functions

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure that the Python path is set correctly to include the project's root directory. This is necessary for the relative imports to work correctly across different modules.

### Setting the Python Path

You can set the Python path by running the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

Alternatively, you can also set the Python path programmatically within the code using:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/project_root')
```

## Running the Code

Once the Python path is set, you can run the main script from the project's root directory:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Dependencies

- PyTorch

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple and concise implementation of a transformer model with attention. It serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to explore the powerful capabilities of attention-based models.
